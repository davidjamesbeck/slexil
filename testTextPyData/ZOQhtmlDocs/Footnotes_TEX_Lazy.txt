These notes were originally footnotes, but they were moved to the introduction of the chapter. Could you add this to the introduction?:
The representation for the person marking paradigm in Texistepec differs from that of the other texts in this volume. There are two intransitive paradigms, reflected in the notation. SA marks ergative subjects of intransitive verbs, and SB marks absolutive subjects of intransitive verbs. The symbol ê represents an underlying segment that surfaces as [e], however it is subject to allophonic variation distinct from /e/. It is not in itself a phoneme; its use here is strictly analytical.

This footnote was included with the by-line:
SW recorded and analyzed the text, LB prepared the English translation and the formatting, and JS is responsible for the original text-to-speech alignment in ELAN.
