            <h3 id="top">SLEXIL basics</h3>
              <p>SLEXIL is a DASH/FLASK web application written in Python that allows users to create animated HTML from ELAN projects for the presentation and playback of texts. SLEXIL is compatible with any modern web browser and does not require the user to install any software on their computers. Project components (.eaf file, sound file, list of abbreviations) can be uploaded through the web interface, configured, and previewed, then downloaded to the user’s computer. This software is Open Source and source code for the project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/paul-shannon/slexil">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <h3>ELAN files</h3>
              <p>SLEXIL works from the .eaf file of an ELAN project. Minimally, the .eaf file should have two tiers, one for transcribed speech and the other a free translation. The file should be time-aligned to the speech tier&mdash;that is, time intervals should correspond to what will be presented as numbered lines in the text. SLEXIL supports two lines of interlinearization consisting of paired annotations on separate tiers that exhaustively parse the line of text being analyzed; mismatched or missing annotations on either of these two lines will generate errors that will appear in the ERRORS.log file that is downloaded with your final project. Two additional tiers can be processed as well, one that will appear immediately below the numbered transcription line and another that will appear immediately below the free translation. These are in a one-to-one relationship to the numbered line and cannot be subdivided into smaller annotations.</p>
            <h3>Sound files</h3>
              <p>SLEXIL uses PySoundFile to handle audio and can accept files in a variety of common formats, including WAV, AIFF, RAW, and FLAC. A full list of acceptable encodings can be found <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features">here</a>. SLEXIL does not currently work with MP3.</p>
            <h3>Abbreviations file</h3>
            <p>If your text is interlinearized, you need to provide a list of abbreviations in plain text (UTF-8) format.
            <ol><li>List each abbreviation on a separate line. Do not include definitions. Give abbreviations in ALL CAPS if that is how they appear in the ELAN file;</li>
            <li>List each part of an abbreviation that comes separated by punctuation on a separate line (e.g., if you have “<smallcaps>pl.poss</smallcaps>” and “<smallcaps>pfv:past</smallcaps>”, list “<smallcaps>pl</smallcaps>”, “<smallcaps>poss</smallcaps>”, “<smallcaps>pfv</smallcaps>”, “<smallcaps>past</smallcaps>” separately);</li>
            <li>Don’t include numbers for grammatical person&mdash;if you have things like “3A” or “1<smallcaps>pl</smallcaps>”, include “A” and “<smallcaps>pl</smallcaps>” in your list, but not “3A”, “1<smallcaps>pl</smallcaps>” or “1”, “2”, “3”;</li>
            <li>Abbreviations that include subparts in superscript or subscript should be included in the list along with HTML tags for super/subscripting&mdash;for example, “1<smallcaps>pl<sub>excl</sub></smallcaps>” would be listed as “1pl&lsaquo;sub&rsaquo;excl&lsaquo;/sub&rsaquo;”. Use “&lsaquo;sup&rsaquo;&lsaquo;/sup&rsaquo;” tags for superscripting in the same way.</li></ol></p>
            <p>Super/subscripting applied to lexical items rather than grammatical abbreviations may have to be applied manually in the HTML file itself.</p>
            <h3>Working with the downloaded project</h3>
              <p>Once you have built your SLEXIL project on the website, it can be downloaded as a folder to your computer. The folder will be named for the title of your project and contains the following: 1) an .html file, also named after your project; 2) a folder called “audio” that contains the sound files needed by the project; 3) a CSS style sheet; 4) a ERRORS log file (this will be empty if all went well); 5) two Javascript files used by the project for playback. The .html file can be opened in any browser and will support line-by-line and continuous playback as long as it is in the same folder as the other project files; the CSS stylesheet can be edited to change the look of the page to your heart’s content. The project can be uploaded to any webserver and will continue to work as long as the directory structure is maintained (or appropriate changes are made to the .html file). With proper modifications, the HTML code can be cut and pasted into various content management systems like WordPress, though the details of this will depend on the system and how it is set up to handle Javascript and media files.</p>
