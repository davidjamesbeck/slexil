Software  Linking Elan Xml to  Illuminated Language

This software is a webapp designed to convert ELAN time-aligned transcription files to animated HTML that allows for continuous highlighted or line by line playback of texts. Texts can be prepared in 2 line (text-translation) or 4 line (text, interlinearization, translation format), and supports the addition of an additional transcription line and a translation into a second language. The software runs on a remote server and is accesed by users via a web-browser and ordinary internet connection. An instance of SLEXIl is currently running at slexil.artsrun.ualberta.ca
